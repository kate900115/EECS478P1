Project 1: BDDs.

A valid boolean expression consists of
(1) single character vars, and 
(2) AND, OR, NOT and parenthesis

 example: (a & !b | !a & b) & c

Choose a print mode: (v)erbose, (n)on-verbose

Enter a boolean expression:
in bdd form:
a 6
 |__b 5
 |  |__c 4
 |  |  |__1
 |  |  |__0
 |  |__0
